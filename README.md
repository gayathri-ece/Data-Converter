# Data-Converter
This small project has a user interface built on html, css and bootstrap at front end which is connected to backend python using flask. The data sheets with excel, json and csv formats can be converted to other format rather than the same format, i.e, the csv file can be converted to excel or in json format and the user downloads the converted file just using pandas module in Python. If other than the supported format file is given as input then user gets error message.
